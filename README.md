This is a documentation file for the programme ePygenetics.

Programme requirements:
 - The programme was scripted using Python 3.5.2 so can only be run in versions compatible with this version, alternatively the user can manually alter the script so it runs on their particular Python version
 - Accordingly a Python interpreter is needed to run the programme
 - The programme was scripted for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, it is yet to be tested for compatibility issues with other operating systems
 - The programme can only read .wig files with a fixed step of 20 in their standard format, see https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/wiggle.html
 - For the programme to read the files, both the script and the files need to be in the same directory
 - At least one .wig file is needed to run the programme
 - For the output to be valid, all files must use the same genome build
 - Files must contain a "-" in their name to be read by the programme, whatever text is before the dash will be the column heading in the database output so bear this in mind when naming files
